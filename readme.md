Hello World!

I'm Tiger.

I was born in 1990s, and living alone in Beijing now. My nickname is Tiger, another name is David.

I am a believer of technology , openness and freedom.

I like Apple's lifestyle and products especially iPhone, Macbook and Apple Watch, but not a full apple fans.

Maybe I could be a Full Stack Developer? But it's not enough. I want to be a all-rounder man in anything I like.

Just 4 fun!
